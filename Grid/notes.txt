= We need to apply:
display: grid;

= To apply spacing we use:
gap: 2px;

= To set up the number of columns:
Note: There are maximun 12 columns in a grid system.
grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25%;

Note: The above code will divide our grid into 3 columns with their own sizes.
- There is one "fr" unit for grid to divide space equally:
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    fr - fraction.
    We can also have 
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr;
- There is one repeat() for repetition:
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); 
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr) 2fr; 


Note: When we define number of columns and there is more content then, grid will automatically create another row
      to fit in the content.
      - These rows are called implicit rows because they are created automatically.
      - We need to try to avoid explicitly defining rows.
